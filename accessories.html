    <p>The fifth edition of this book might as well be the first edition of a brand-new book.
        The HTML5 specification marks a return to past ideas and an explosion of future
        ideas. It took a great deal of work to put this new edition together. Given the amount
        of effort required, I want to make sure that all those that helped are given their due. First, I
        want to acknowledge the numerous fixes and improvements that came from the feedback
        from both my students at UCSD and readers around the world. I write these books for you,
        and I am glad you are putting this information to good use.
        I would also like to show my appreciation to the many staff members at PINT who
        helped on this book project in some direct or indirect way. I can’t specifically thank and
        mention the dozens of employees we have at PINT and my other firm Port80 Software who
        keep the lights on, but I’ll call a few out who warrant some extra kudos.
        Christie Sorenson once again helped this time with heavy lifting particularly in the CSS
        effort, and I can safely say that she has learned, relearned, and even forgotten more about
        Web development than probably anyone I know, besides maybe myself. Looking forward to
        more project fun in the future, Christie!
        Plenty of other PINTsters helped. Rob McFarlane, Andrew Simpkins, and Bryan Sleiter
        helped out with imagery. The project managers, particularly Mine Okano, Robin Nobel,
        Matt Plotner, and Olivia Chen, gave me moral support and occasional pity as I toiled away
        upstairs. Glenn Dawson addressed my many server changes and helped debug some
        annoying aspects of HTML5. Dan Whitworth assisted on a few chapters here and there and
        probably had nightmares about getting a call to really dive in.
        Joe Lima listened to some of my verbal nonsense and helped guide me to some deeper
        insights than I could have ever arrived at on my own.
        Daisy Bhonsle kept up a very long-standing proofing relationship, and I am very glad
        she always helps out. The student certainly has become the master.
        The folks at McGraw-Hill Professional are always a pleasure to work with. Meghan
        Riley helped guide me along, and Megg Morin didn’t lose faith, at least not completely.
        Thanks for being my patron the last decade, Megg!
        My technical editor, James Pence, probably wondered when this project was going to
        finish, and somehow he finished a nontechnical book of his own during the project.The Web is an interesting place technology-wise because the mob tends to rule. Very often,
        well-defined specifications will be built only to be avoided or replaced by ad hoc specifications
        that appear to spring out of nowhere. HTML5 tries to tame the mob and bring a bit of order
        to the chaos, but that doesn’t come easily, particularly when politics and competition are
        involved.
        On the Web, there are those who promote openness, and those who promote new
        proprietary features for their own browsers. Some will label such organizations good or
        bad, and declare their technology the one true way over others. Such promotion of us
        versus them can create loyal followers, but the author finds some of the discussion more
        than a bit disingenuous.
        Web technologies that were once maligned as proprietary Microsoft features, such as
        innerHTML, contenteditable, Ajax XMLHttpRequest object, and more, have been quietly
        absorbed into the open Web community. Other capabilities such as CSS transformations,
        behaviors, Web fonts, and animations found in Internet Explorer—in many cases for the better
        part of a decade—are also maligned as proprietary only to be reintroduced with slight syntax
        differences by other browser vendors to hails of the progress of the open Web. “Today
        proprietary, tomorrow standard” seems to be the rule of Web standards, and it would seem
        that now HTML5 is doing its part to continue politics as usual.
        Google has already begun a tremendous push to promote HTML5. The problem is the term
        is basically being used as a comparison as to what a major competitor is not supporting, more
        than a lucid discussion of the emerging technology. Unfortunately, from my observations,
        when most people speak of HTML5, it is more as a code for open Web or even anti-Microsoft,
        which reminds me of other misused terms of the last browser battles. Let’s hope that cool
        heads prevail in the standards fights that will likely ensue.
